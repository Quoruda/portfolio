# Portfolio

My personal portfolio disguised as an operating system. Built with Vue 3 and Vite.

**[Live demo](https://Quoruda.github.io/portfolio)**

## What's inside

The whole thing works like a desktop OS - boot screen, login, and a draggable window system. You can browse my projects, read documentation with syntax highlighting, or mess around with the calculator and notes app.

## Tech

Vue 3, Vite, Marked, Prism.js

Hosted on GitHub Pages.
