# **NodalPy**

![Application Screenshot](/nodalpy/concept.png)

The idea for this project came to me while using **[Automatic1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)**, an interface for image/video generation with **[Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion)**. NodalPy uses **nodes** to create **modular workflows** for custom image generation or data processing. Other tools, like **[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)**, also offer node-based languages ([**visual programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language)).

This approach is interesting: it offers a **clear vision** of the program via small blocks that take advantage of the screen's **verticality** and **horizontality**. However, most existing interfaces are **limited** and do not allow for creating **custom nodes** easily.

This is where **NodalPy** comes in. NodalPy is a tool that allows **Python code execution** from **editable nodes**. Each node can be **customized** with its own code, **input and output variables**, facilitating the creation and organization of **modular workflows**.

## **Technologies Used**

The project is separated into two main parts:
* The **backend** in **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** (using **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)**), which manages **node execution** and application logic.
* The **frontend** in **[React](https://react.dev/)**, which provides a modern **interactive user interface** for creating and managing nodes.

The project was developed to be flexible: it can run as a local web application, or as a desktop application thanks to **[PyWebView](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/)**, offering a lightweight native experience.

## **Current Features**

For now, NodalPy is designed for **local** use. It integrates several node types to cover various needs:

- **FastNodes**: These nodes execute **automatically** and **reactively**. As soon as you modify code or a connection, the result is instantly recalculated (with a "debounce" system for performance).
- **Custom Nodes**: For heavier tasks or those requiring precise control, these nodes execute only when you manually decide. They are isolated, ensuring that an error doesn't crash the entire flow.
- **Value Nodes**: Ready-to-use blocks for injecting typed data (Integers, Floats, Text, Files, etc.).
- **Observer Node**: A powerful tool to **visualize** results in real-time. It supports text, numbers, but also **images** (generated by **Matplotlib**, **PIL**, or base64) and interactive data formatting (JSON/Tables).

## **Upcoming Features**

The project continues to evolve with the goal of adding:
- **External Libraries**: Simplified management to import and use any installed Python library.
- **Cloud Support**: The ability to execute heavy workflows on a remote server.
- **Plugin System**: To allow the community to create and share their own node types.
