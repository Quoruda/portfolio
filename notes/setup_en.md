# My Development Setup

## Open Source Philosophy

I primarily use open source tools for my development workflow. This allows me to better understand the tools I use, contribute to projects, and customize my environment according to my needs.

- APT package management
- Performance and complete system control

## Browsers

### Firefox (primary)
- Open source and privacy-respecting

- Extensions: uBlock Origin, React DevTools, Vue DevTools

### Chromium (testing)
- For cross-browser compatibility testing

## IDE & Editors

### VSCodium (primary)
- Open source version of VS Code without Microsoft telemetry
